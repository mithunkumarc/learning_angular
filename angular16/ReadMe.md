todo example : ngComponentOutlet 

#### ViewContainerRef 

    is a powerful and flexible API for dynamically creating and manipulating views and components in 
    Angular, there are a few alternatives and complementary approaches depending on your specific use case: 
    ngComponentOutlet and ngTemplateOutlet

#### ngComponentOutlet:

    This directive allows you to dynamically load a component into the view. It is simpler to use 
    compared to ViewContainerRef and ComponentFactoryResolver.

#### ngTemplateOutlet:
      
      This directive allows you to dynamically insert an ng-template into the view. 
      It is useful when you want to dynamically load a template rather than a component.
